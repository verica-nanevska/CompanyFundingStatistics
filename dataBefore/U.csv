They&#8217;re trying to differentiate themselves from other free game sites by giving users points for time spent playing, which can later be redeemed for prizes.  Ujogo can afford to give away these prizes due to money made from ads shown during games.</p>

<p>Jul 19, 2007 was a big day for the San Francisco based site.  They announced the launch of their public beta, a round of Series A funding and the acquisition of game developer Gaming Everywhere.</p>

<p>It is unknown how long the site will be in public beta.  Ujogo still has a long way to go with only one game currently available and no way to redeem points yet.</p>;$0
