<p>In the past year, jaxtr has introduced a number of additional services in the attempt to monetize the company&#8217;s 10 million users:</p>

<p>-Jaxtr helps users bypass expensive international phone charges by giving them free local numbers in the countries that they&#8217;re calling to and charges a nominal fee for connection and the ability to call from a mobile phone. As a marketing ploy, the company permits free calls to other members.
-Jaxtr uses cafe jaxtr, a social network in which people call one another to discuss similar interests, and free global SMS to attract activity on its website and generate advertising revenue.</p>

<p>The company maintains an advantage over competitors such as <a href="www.skype.com" title="Skype" rel="nofollow">Skype</a> by allowing customers to use any phone - mobile or landline - without the need to download software or maintain Internet access, and calling cards by eliminating the need to dial additional numbers and PIN codes. </p>;$21.5M
