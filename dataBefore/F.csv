Users can create their own profiles, invite friends, rate movies and actors, and post movie reviews as well. From the site, people can also get information about movies, read user-generated movie reviews and ratings, converse with other users, get movie showtimes, view popular celebrity photos, read the latest movie news, and view video clips from popular movies and TV shows. </p>

<p>With so many features, Flixster seems to have created a fairly comprehensive movie social networking site, which may in turn explain its rapid growth in popularity. Flixster currently has over 50 million registered users with over 1.5 billion movie ratings, and has already outpaced (in total page views) other movie sites such as Fandango. And while the site is still dwarfed in terms of total page views by the more informationally-based IMDB, its emphasis on combining social networking with movies and rapid rise in user base make for a promising company future.</p>;$7.18M
