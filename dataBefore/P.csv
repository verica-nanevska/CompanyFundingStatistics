Founded in 2004, PeerMe is now situated in a field of numerous competitors trying to advance in the burgeoning VOIP market while attempting to chip away at incumbent leader Skype.  The company developed a secure messaging platform that offers PC to PC and PC to mobile instant messaging, p2p file transfer and voice communications.  For calls to any phone there is a charge, but as with all VOIP companies, calls are substantially less than they are on regular carriers.  Calls can be paid for using prepaid PeerMe cards or through PayPal.The company has raised a modest amount of funding, but continues to put forth challenges to its competitors which include <a href="http://crunchbase.com/company/barablu" title="barablu">barablu</a>, <a href="http://crunchbase.com/company/skype" title="Skype">Skype</a>, <a href="http://crunchbase.com/company/connectmeanywhere" title="ConnectMeAnywhere">ConnectMeAnywhere</a>, <a href="http://crunchbase.com/company/jajah" title="jajah">jajah</a> and others.</p>;$5M
