Much like an e-mail inbox, coComment notifies users of new comment posts while also displaying any comments and conversations that a user may be tracking on sites such as blogs, news sites, and photosharing sites.  coComment&#8217;s website has a complete list of compatible platforms than can be tracked including, for instance, popular sites like <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/digg" title="Digg">Digg</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/flickr" title="Flickr">Flickr</a>.  For bloggers, coComment is useful because it lets them display comments made elsewhere back on their own blogs as well. coComment is free and the company&#8217;s browser extension can easily be downloaded from the website.</p><p>According to coComment&#8217;s own web-page (as of 17th February 2012) &#8230; &#8220;The service will be switched off at 31.3.2012 at midnight 12:00 am.&#8221; The main webserver can no longer be reached.</p>;$5.6M
