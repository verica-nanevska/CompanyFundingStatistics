Since 2005, barablu has been developing ways to let its users make free phone calls from mobile phones.  In 2006, it became the first company to offer free calling from WiFi capable phones.

Already, barablu&#8217;s service is compatible with Windows Mobile as well as Nokia Symbian S60 phones.  barablu has plans to make its platform functional between WiFi and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM" title="GSM" rel="nofollow">GSM</a> in the near future.</p><p>barablu calls are generally free with a few unfortunate exceptions.  Calls to regular land lines are charged as well as calls to non-barablu phones.  The only free calls a barablu user will get are those to other&#8217;s who have downloaded the barablu mobile application.</p><p>barablu lets you import contacts from Google Talk, Skype and most recently, Yahoo Messenger.</p>;$0
