The site allows people to create profiles so they can share memories and remember lost loved ones in a personalized way. Respectance lets you create a tribute to people who have died by uploading text, photos, and videos. With these features, family and friends have a common online space in which they can heal and remember. The site can be used to create tributes for anyone who has died, and so it is interesting to see that Respectance has a number of tributes for dead celebrities as well. With the availability of groups on the website, people can also find and connect with others who have experienced similar losses. There exist groups like &#8220;Just Lost Mom,&#8221; &#8220;Iraq,&#8221; and others so that people can heal together, offer support, and give advice. Ultimately, Respectance offers an honest service that aims to help people cope with death. Their revenue model is not based on advertising, but rather by charging money for extra services (for instance, it costs $1 to download a funeral video). As a niche social networking site, Respectance has certainly chosen to take on a unique market sector, and time will only tell if this is one that can work.</p>	$1.75M
